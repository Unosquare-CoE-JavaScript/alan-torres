// Lexical Scope
// Made in parse stage, before runtime. Lex shares the same root as the first stage of parsing, the lexa.
// Is fixed at author time and it's predictable, it is not affected by run time conditions.


// Dynamic scope
// Ex: Bash script
// Runtime conditions affect the scoping tree.
