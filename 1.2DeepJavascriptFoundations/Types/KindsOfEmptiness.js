// undefined vs. undeclared

// undeclared: a variable never been created in any scope that we have access to.
// undefined: a variable exist, and at the moment it has no value.

// uninitialized (aka TDZ): certain variables like block scope ones, don't get initialized, they never initially 
// get set to undefined.
