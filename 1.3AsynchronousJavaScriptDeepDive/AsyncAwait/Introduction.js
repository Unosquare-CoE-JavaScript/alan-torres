// async: is used with a function, when async is used as a part of a function definition, it forces
    // the function to return a promise. If the function is already returning a value, that value is 
    // wrapped in a promise.

// await: 
    // - It can only be used inside an async function.
    // - It waits for a promise.
    // - It causes the async function to pause.
